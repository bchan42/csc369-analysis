# Final Analysis Files: Notebooks & Markdown Files

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for analyzing food distribution and diversity across different college towns comparing to SLO. Below are descriptions of each notebook:


- **parsing.ipynb** – Using osmium, filter through and creates several subsets of the raw dataset. Parses the filtered datasets, extracting relevant information for analysis.

- **data_conv_approaches.ipynb** – Before parsing, I had tried other methods for data conversion to a nicer format to work with for analysis.

- **clean.ipynb** – Prepares and cleans all the food datasets from each town, handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.

- **matplotlib.ipynb** – Creates various plots using Matplotlib to explore food distribution trends.

- **folium.ipynb** – Uses Folium to visualize food locations on interactive maps and saves them as HTML. The folium folder contains all the HTML maps. 

- **final_analysis.ipynb** – Combines all visuals used in final analysis report in a single notebook (in addtion, any other visuals I tried). These include some data exploration visuals, and more map visuals with Folium like distance analysis and K-Mean Clustering techniques.


Additional markdown files:
- **analysis_proposal.md** – Initial proposal outlining the research questions and approach.

- **data_issues.md** – Documents data parsing and quality issues.

- **file_descriptions.md** - This file includes description of each file in the final_analysis folder.
